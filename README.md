Project Report: Automating EC2 Deployment on AWS using Terraform

Introduction:
This project aims to automate the deployment of an EC2 instance on AWS using Terraform. Terraform is a powerful Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows us to define and provision infrastructure resources in a declarative manner.

I  Setting up the Environment

 1. Install Terraform: Ensure Terraform is installed on your machine. You can download Terraform from the official website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
 
 2. Install AWS CLI: Ensure AWS CLI is installed on your machine. You can install it using the package manager of your choice or follow the instructions provided on the AWS CLI documentation.

 3. Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository from GitHub using the command :
     git clone

II Configuring AWS Credentials

 1. Configure AWS CLI: If you haven't already configured AWS CLI with your access key and secret key, you can do so by running the following command and following the prompts:
  aws configure

III Understanding Terraform Configuration Files

 1. main.tf: This file contains the main Terraform configuration for provisioning the EC2 instance. Let's break down the contents of main.tf:

---
 provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
 }

 resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
  }
 }
 provider "aws" block configures the AWS provider with the specified region.
 resource "aws_instance" block defines an EC2 instance resource. It specifies the AMI, instance type, and tags for the instance.

 aws ec2 describe-images --owners 099720109477 --filters to find the ami of ubuntu "Name=name,Values=ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-*-*-amd64-server-*" --query "Images[*].[ImageId,Name]" --output table

  
  2. variables.tf: This file contains variable definitions used in the Terraform configuration:

 variable "aws_region" {
  description = "The AWS region where resources will be created"
  type        = string
 }

 variable "ami_id" {
  description = "The ID of the AMI to use for the EC2 instance"
  type        = string
 }

 variable "instance_type" {
  description = "The type of EC2 instance to launch"
  type        = string
 }
 variable blocks define input variables used in the Terraform configuration. They specify the type and description of each variable.
IV Executing Terraform Commands

 1. Initialize Terraform: Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to initialize Terraform:

terraform init
 2. Review Terraform Plan: Run the following command to generate and review the execution plan:
terraform plan

 3. Apply Terraform Changes: Apply the Terraform configuration to provision the EC2 instance:
terraform apply

V Accessing Outputs

 After successfully applying the Terraform configuration, you can view the outputs generated by Terraform:
terraform output

Conclusion:
By following the above steps,  successfully automated the deployment of an EC2 instance on AWS using Terraform. Terraform's declarative approach allows for efficient provisioning and management of infrastructure resources, making it an essential tool for infrastructure automation.

Appendix:

main.tf: Contains the main Terraform configuration.
variables.tf: Contains variable definitions.
terraform.tfvars: Contains values for input variables (can be used to override default values).
outputs.tf: Contains output definitions  can be used to display useful information after provisioning resources).


Fututre scope:
1. we can also centralize the terraform.tfstate file(which has sensitive information related to terraform) by storing it in S3 bucket and adding versioning to S3. reason : when a a one person  in organization excuted terraform ,  terraform.tfstate will  be available in his laptop. if he makes any changes to that file, developed terraform infrastructure code will not work. to avoid that we store it in S3. Versioning is when the second/third person runs the code terraform.tfstate file keeps changing, to keep track of the changes made by terraform into cloud we do versioning to S3.

2. By using Dynamodb we can lock the terraform.tfstate file for avoiding the parallel execution.
